Some of the teachers think that taking money from the students is a requirement not to refer anyone. I personally don't think it is right, let the students write a genuine exam, get genuine grades, and those who couldn't pass let them resit. We are not adding value to the education. For instance I wrote a paper that I knew for sure I would get an A but I got D+ simply because my name was not part of those who bought a teacher handbook, and I see this to be very unfortunate. I know someone who was in my class and we always see each others results and I have performed far better but on the day of graduating she was awarded first class, I don't know how it happens. The university needs to sit up to provide geniue results to students.",

When Central University proposed something be it increments and deadline of fees are scheduled, they don't want to hear with us the student body for our petition. We understand that, they goes by regulations but is too much. However, Central University don't care about the welfare of the student especially the nursing department, the administration talk to us anyhow and don't regard us ,.tag us badly and so on. I kindly suggest that, More should be put in place especially the nursing student most importantly, the professionals. Because we will spread the good news to people to also come to the school and keep the school going. Thanks",
